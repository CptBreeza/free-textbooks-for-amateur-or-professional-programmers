## Introduction

This is a book list for amateur programmers - and also professional ones - who want to learn the fundamental **theories** on CS. Only the best of free textbooks and lecture notes are collected. They are introductory, accessible, entertaining and with beautiful typography.

A good guide can be found [here](https://teachyourselfcs.com). A (way) more comprehensive list of textbooks that are freely available online can be found [here](https://csgordon.github.io/books.html).
